# Compiler Design for Layman Friendly Calculator
This project is focused on making a language descriptor and compiler for layman friendly Calculator where a user can enter the english sentences for all calculations.

For example,
Valid program in language :

ADD 23 WITH 444.45 . ALSO ADD 4543.78 TO 123 . NOW DO ADDITION OF BOTH ANSWERS . WHAT IS RESULT?
The above language is to be processed by the compiler designed by us and calculate appropriate result from it.
